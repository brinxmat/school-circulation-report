# School circulation report generator for Koha bookmarklet
A bookmarklet for generating school circulation reports in Oslo public library's Koha installation.

##What is a bookmarklet?
A bookmarklets are bookmarks that hide executable javascript snippets that do things in your webbrowser. This should sound a bit worrying; we're using them for good here, honest.

##Building

You've got two choices:

###Simple, manual
- copy code in ```src/main.js```
- google "simple bookmarklet creator", click a link
- follow instructions

###Build with node
- open a terminal
- install node and npm if you don't have them
- clone the project
- cd into the project
- type ```make```

This produces two files in the build directory: index.html and index.js; the first can be opened in a webbrowser and you can follow the instructions for installation there (you can edit the bookmark name too); the contents of the second file can be copied and pasted into a new bookmark and your desired name for the bookmark can be entered.

##Caveats

- Tested with Chrome as this is our kiosk tool
- Will break at some point and need updating
- Norwegian text for Deichman everywhere

##Keeping it all clean — when built with node
Because bookmarklets are getting rolled out all the time, it's nice to be able to check that the version in use is up to date. To do this, just add ```GITREF``` to any URL, hit enter and click the bookmarklet; this will return the git revision number of the version you are using. 

Be aware, however, that you're — of course — looking at the local hash, rather than that of the remote.
